In machine learning, factorization methods are a class of techniques used to decompose complex structures, such as matrices or tensors, into simpler, more manageable components. These methods are crucial for various tasks, including dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and collaborative filtering, particularly in recommendation systems. Here are some key factorization methods commonly used in machine learning:

1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**:
   - PCA is a statistical technique used to identify the principal components that capture the most variance in the data. It reduces the dimensionality of the data by transforming the original variables into a new set of variables, which are linear combinations of the original variables, arranged by their level of variance.

2. **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**:
   - SVD is a powerful matrix factorization method that decomposes any given matrix into three other matrices. It identifies the decomposition of matrices as a product of an orthogonal matrix, a diagonal matrix, and the transpose of an orthogonal matrix. SVD is widely used in signal processing and statistics.

3. **Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)**:
   - NMF is a group of algorithms in multivariate analysis where a matrix \( V \) is factorized into (usually) two matrices \( W \) and \( H \), with the property that all three matrices have no negative elements. This non-negativity makes the resulting matrices easier to inspect. NMF is commonly applied in audio signal processing and text mining.

4. **QR Decomposition**:
   - QR decomposition is a method that decomposes a matrix into a product of an orthogonal matrix and an upper triangular matrix. It is used in solving linear least squares problems efficiently and is fundamental in certain eigenvalue algorithms.

5. **LU Decomposition**:
   - LU decomposition factors a matrix as the product of a lower triangular matrix and an upper triangular matrix. It is used in numerical analysis and other algorithms to solve systems of linear equations, invert matrices, and compute determinants.

6. **Cholesky Decomposition**:
   - Cholesky decomposition is used to decompose a symmetric, positive-definite matrix into a lower triangular matrix and its conjugate transpose. It is typically used to solve systems of linear equations and in optimization algorithms.

7. **Eigen Decomposition**:
   - Also known as eigenvector decomposition, this method involves decomposing a matrix into eigenvectors and eigenvalues. It is a crucial step in many statistical analyses, including those in principal component analysis and differential equations.

These factorization methods provide frameworks for reducing complexity, enhancing interpretability, and solving diverse problems in machine learning and beyond. They are foundational for understanding relationships within high-dimensional data sets and making predictions or recommendations based on those data.
